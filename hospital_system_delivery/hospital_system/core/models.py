    Dedicated counter rows for generating sequential human-readable IDs
    (PAT-2026-0001, INV-2026-0001, etc) that are 100% safe under concurrent
    requests - even when many staff hit 'register' at the exact same instant.

    Why this exists: locking "the last existing row matching a prefix" doesn't
    work when zero rows exist yet (the very first ID of the year) - there's
    nothing to lock, so concurrent requests can't be serialized. A counter row
    that always exists, locked via select_for_update, solves this completely.
